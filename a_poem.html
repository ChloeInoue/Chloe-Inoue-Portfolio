	<title>A Poem Written by ChatGPT in the Style of Ross Gay</title>
  <h1>Ode to a Strawberry Plant in Brooklyn</h1>
		
<p>On the stoop,<br>
<p>your leaves stretch wide like you’ve found<br>
<p>a patch of sun between these buildings,<br>
<p>rooted in a pot I carried from the bodega<br>
<p>last spring.<br>


<p>Here, in this city of clamor and concrete,<br>
<p>you remind me to look close—<br>
<p>how you grow in silence,<br>
<p>unhurried among the fire escapes<br>
<p>and the hum of bus engines,<br>
<p>your fruit a quiet rebellion<br>
<p>against the asphalt.<br>	

<p>Your vines spill gently,<br>
<p>twisting around the railing,<br>
<p>weaving stories with the ivy,<br>
<p>as if you know that in this place,<br>
<p>we all find ways to stretch and cling,<br>
<p>to make something of what we’re given.<br>

<p>And there you are—<br>
<p>bright spots of red, hidden beneath green,<br>
<p>a kind of small miracle<br>
<p>in this tangle of noise and iron.<br>
	
<p>The kids on the block run past,<br>
<p>skateboards loud against the sidewalk,<br>
<p>and I wonder if they see you,<br>
<p>this little patch of hope<br>
<p>waving in the wind.<br>

<p>When the berries come,<br>
<p>I’ll pluck them, not for myself,<br>
<p>but to share, to say,<br>
<p>Look what grew here,<br>
<p>look what can still bloom,<br>
<p>even in the midst of all this.<br>
