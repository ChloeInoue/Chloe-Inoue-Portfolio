    <h1>Ode to a Strawberry Plant in Brooklyn</h1>
    <h2>A Poem Written by ChatGPT in the Style of Ross Gay (ChatGPT, 2024)</h2>  
    
    <p>On the stoop,<br>
    your leaves stretch wide like you’ve found<br>
    a patch of sun between these buildings,<br>
    rooted in a pot I carried from the bodega<br>
    last spring.<br></p>

    <p>Here, in this city of clamor and concrete,<br>
    you remind me to look close—<br>
    how you grow in silence,<br>
    unhurried among the fire escapes<br>
    and the hum of bus engines,<br>
    your fruit a quiet rebellion<br>
    against the asphalt.<br></p>
    
    <p>Your vines spill gently,<br>
    twisting around the railing,<br>
    weaving stories with the ivy,<br>
    as if you know that in this place,<br>
    we all find ways to stretch and cling,<br>
    to make something of what we’re given.<br></p>

    <p>And there you are—<br>
    bright spots of red, hidden beneath green,<br>
    a kind of small miracle<br>
    in this tangle of noise and iron.<br></p>
    
    <p>The kids on the block run past,<br>
    skateboards loud against the sidewalk,<br>
    and I wonder if they see you,<br>
    this little patch of hope<br>
    waving in the wind.<br></p>

    <p>When the berries come,<br>
    I’ll pluck them, not for myself,<br>
    but to share, to say,<br>
    Look what grew here,<br>
    look what can still bloom,<br>
    even in the midst of all this.<br></p>
