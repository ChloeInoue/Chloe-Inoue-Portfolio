	<h1>A Poem Written by ChatGPT in the Style of Ross Gay</h1>
  <h2>Ode to a Strawberry Plant in Brooklyn</h1>
<h3>
On the stoop,
your leaves stretch wide like you’ve found
a patch of sun between these buildings,
rooted in a pot I carried from the bodega
last spring.
</h3>

<h3>
Here, in this city of clamor and concrete,
you remind me to look close—
how you grow in silence,
unhurried among the fire escapes
and the hum of bus engines,
your fruit a quiet rebellion
against the asphalt.
</h3>	

<h3>
Your vines spill gently,
twisting around the railing,
weaving stories with the ivy,
as if you know that in this place,
we all find ways to stretch and cling,
to make something of what we’re given.
</h3>

<h3>
And there you are—
bright spots of red, hidden beneath green,
a kind of small miracle
in this tangle of noise and iron.
</h3>	

<h3>	
The kids on the block run past,
skateboards loud against the sidewalk,
and I wonder if they see you,
this little patch of hope
waving in the wind.
</h3>

<h3>
When the berries come,
I’ll pluck them, not for myself,
but to share, to say,
Look what grew here,
look what can still bloom,
even in the midst of all this.
</h3>
